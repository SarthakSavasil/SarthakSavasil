### Glad to see you here!  


_Formal Intro? Sure_

_To start about me, I am a Computer Science Engineering underGrad at IIIT Nagpur with keen interest in Backend Development. My skill set comprises of Java, CPP, SQL and somewhat Android development (:P)._

_Currently, I am working with [Groww, India](https://www.groww.in) as an SDE Intern. Also I have previously worked with [Turno](https://www.turno.club) for a span of 3 months as Backend Developer Intern. Always been in love with problem solving and DSA, and 
now also fascinated by System Design and Software Architecture :)_
